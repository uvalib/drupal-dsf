# Safe Email Alternative Implementation

## Overview
The original email functionality in the Drupal DSF application has been safely disabled and replaced with user-controlled alternatives that don't involve server-side email sending.

## What Was Disabled
1. **Email Form**: The original email form with name/email fields and send buttons
2. **Backend Email Endpoint**: The `/rest/sendemail` endpoint now returns a disabled message
3. **Server Email Sending**: All `mail()` functionality has been commented out

## New Safe Features Implemented

### 1. Print Results
- **Button**: "Print Results" with printer icon
- **Functionality**: Opens a new window with formatted results that users can print
- **Data Included**: Selected criteria, matching services, current URL, timestamp

### 2. Copy to Clipboard
- **Button**: "Copy to Clipboard" with copy icon  
- **Functionality**: Copies formatted text results to user's clipboard
- **Fallback**: Works with older browsers using fallback method
- **Feedback**: Shows success message when copy succeeds

### 3. Generate Email (User-Controlled)
- **Button**: "Generate Email" with envelope icon
- **Process**: 
  1. User clicks button
  2. Email preview appears showing formatted content
  3. User reviews the content
  4. User clicks "Open in Email Client" 
  5. User's default email client opens with pre-filled content
  6. User can edit and send the email themselves

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **Template**: `/web/themes/custom/uva_dsf_bs/templates/finder.html.twig`
   - Replaced email form with new action buttons
   - Added email preview interface

2. **Styles**: `/web/themes/custom/uva_dsf_bs/css/style.css`
   - Added styling for new interface elements
   - Removed/commented old email form styles

3. **JavaScript**: `/web/themes/custom/uva_dsf_bs/js/results-actions.js` (NEW)
   - Handles all new functionality
   - Extracts selected criteria and services
   - Formats data for print, copy, and email
   - Manages UI interactions

4. **Library**: `/web/themes/custom/uva_dsf_bs/uva_dsf_bs.libraries.yml`
   - Added new JavaScript file to theme library

5. **Backend**: `/web/modules/custom/finder/src/Controller/FinderController.php`
   - Email endpoint returns "disabled" message

## Data Format
The formatted results include:
- **Header**: "Data Storage Finder Results"
- **Selected Criteria**: Question/answer pairs from user selections
- **Matching Services**: Title and description of selected services  
- **URL**: Link back to current page with selections
- **Timestamp**: When results were generated

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Security**: No server-side email sending eliminates security risks
2. **User Control**: Users have full control over what gets sent and to whom
3. **Privacy**: No email addresses stored or processed by the server
4. **Flexibility**: Users can modify email content before sending
5. **Multiple Options**: Print, copy, and email options suit different user preferences

## Testing
The implementation is now ready for testing at: https://drupal-dsf.ddev.site:8443/finder

Users can:
1. Make selections in the finder
2. Scroll to the "Save or share your results" section
3. Test the three buttons: Print, Copy, and Generate Email
