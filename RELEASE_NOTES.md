    if (hasSelectedServices) {
        $('#empty-comparison-message').hide();
        $('#comparisonchart').show();

"uvalib/cd-finder-uva": "dev-feature/share-link-functionality"
```

### Cache Clearing
After deployment, ensure Drupal cache is cleared:
```bash
ddev drush cr
```

### Browser Compatibility
- All modern browsers supported
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach maintained

## üìã Testing Recommendations

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Verify empty state message appears when no services selected
- [ ] Test URL persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Confirm share functionality works correctly
- [ ] Validate accessibility with screen readers

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Ensure original Cornell functionality remains intact
- [ ] Verify service filtering still works correctly
- [ ] Test comparison table functionality
- [ ] Confirm mobile responsiveness

## üîÆ Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Consider additional sharing options (social media, etc.)
- Evaluate user analytics for feature usage
- Explore advanced filtering capabilities
- Consider API endpoints for programmatic access

### Maintenance Notes
- Monitor URL parameter limits for complex selections
- Consider permalink storage optimization
- Plan for potential migration to newer Drupal versions
